### YAML:

It was first called Yet Another MarkUp Langugae but now it is Yaml Ain't MarkUp Language.

### Definition:

Applications written with different technologies or languages which have different _Data Structures_ can transfer data to each other using a _Common/ Standerd Format_. YAML, JSON and XML are these formats

It is a Data Serialization Language

- Data Serialization:
  Translation of Object (Code + Data) into stream of bytes that saves the state of this object in a form that is transmittable. Using Serialization, data can be converted into code and code can be converted into data again.

Benifits of YAML:

- Simple and easy to read
- Nice and Strict Syntax
- Most Languages use it
- More powerful when representing complex data

**_Note: Any JSON input can be converted to YAML output and vice virse_**
